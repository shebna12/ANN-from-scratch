# ANN-from-scratch
A Python implementation of Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs) from Scratch.

# Notes
 - This has only two hidden layers.
 - This implementation uses the sigmoid activation function.
 - Stopping criterion depends on the set threshold.

# Parameters
 - `n_h1` = number of nodes for the first hidden layer
 - `n_h2` = number of nodes for the second hidden layer
 - `eta` = learning rate parameter
 - `max_epoch` maximum number of iterations 
 - `thresh` = threshold, if cost function is less than the threshold, stop the training process.
